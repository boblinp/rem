Here we refer to them as *A* and *B*.\r\n\r\nYou must also ensure that you have compiled a linux kernel source in *A*'s system and boot *A* with the new kernel. The kernel version preferably is 2.6.39.2.\r\n\r\nInstall(On *A*):\r\n+For *B*\r\ninstall *iperf* (Ubuntu user just run `apt-get install iperf`)\r\n+For *A*\r\n1. Download source(and unzip)\r\n\r\n2. open your kernel source file \"<kernel source dir.>/include/linux/pkt_sched.h\"\r\n\r\n   insert the content of \"./patch/rem\\_patch\\_content\" just before \"/* GRED section */\"\r\n   \r\n3. from the terminal navigate to source folder *rem* and run `make`\r\n\r\n4. install *iperf* and *gnuplot* (Ubuntu user just run `apt-get install iperf gnuplot`)\r\n\r\nTest:\r\nNote: Premise of test is that *A* can ping *B* and *B* can ping *A*.\r\n\r\n+For *B*\r\nrun `iperf -s` \r\n+For *A*,\r\n1. from the terminal navigate to source folder *rem*\r\n\r\n2. run `cd test && ./autotest` and wait 50 seconds util the test is done.\r\n\r\n   Not surprisingly, you'll see the drawing of test results.\r\n\r\n### Examples of Results ###\r\n\r\n![rem 1Gbps(port)-100Mbps(link)-1Gbps(port)](https://github.com/zheolong/rem/blob/master/pic_in_readme/1.png)\r\n> ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
